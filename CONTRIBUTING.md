# How to contribute

## OBS Releases

The CI will automatically interact with SUSE's [Open Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org): the master branch will be kept in sync with the `network:ha-clustering:sap-deployments:devel` project (the development upstream), while a new Submit Request against the `openSUSE:Factory` project (the stable downstream) can be triggered by publishing a new GitHub release or pushing a new Git tag.

When releasing to `openSUSE:Factory`, please ensure that tags always follow the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) scheme, and that [the changelog](python-shaptools.changes) contains a new entry, otherwise the request submission might fail.

#### Note to maintainers

The OBS projects can be changed via various environment variables like `OBS_PROJECT` and `TARGET_PROJECT` in the Travis settings.
You can enable the OBS delivery for feature branches in your own fork by setting the variable `DELIVER_BRANCHES` to a non-empty value.
